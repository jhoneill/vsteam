# Remove-VSTeamWorkItemField

## SYNOPSIS

<!-- #include "./synopsis/Remove-VSTeamWorkItemField.md" -->

## SYNTAX

## DESCRIPTION
Every WorkItem has multiple data-fields, and Fields are part of the definition of a Workitem type. This command is to remove custom and ineherited Fields from the definitions of WorkItem types, undoing a previous change by an Add- or Set- command. System fields cannot be removed, and removing an inherited field reverts the field back to its system definition

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-VSTeamWorkItemField -WorkItemType Impediment -ReferenceName Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority -ProcessTemplate Scrum5 -force

```

In the example for Set-VSTeamWorkItemField, the Priority field of the impediment WorkItem type was modified, here the inherited field is deleted taking the field back to its original definition.  Attempting to delete a system field does not return an error or make any change

## PARAMETERS

<!-- #include "./params/forcegroup.md" -->

<!-- #include "./params/processTemplate.md" -->

<!-- #include "./params/workItemType.md" -->

### -ReferenceName
The reference name of the field. The command will attempt to resolve a partial name like "ClosedDate" to its full reference name, like "Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ClosedDate". Values for the field names should tab-complete.
