<!-- #include "./synopsis/Get-VSTeamProcess.md" -->

## SYNTAX

## DESCRIPTION

The list of Process Templates can be filtered by name  (which may include Wildcard). You can also get a single Process Template by id

You must call Set-VSTeamAccount before calling this function.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
Get-VSTeamProcess
```

This will return all the Process Templates

### Example 2

```powershell
Get-VSTeamProcess | Format-Wide
```

This will return the Process Templates only showing their name

### Example 3

```powershell
Get-VSTeamProcess *scrum*
```

This will return all process templates with names containing "scrum",
in other words, the default "Scrum" template and custom ones with
names like "Custom Scrum", "Scrum for Contoso" will all be returned.

### Example 4

```powershell
Get-VSTeamProcess  -ExpandProjects | where Projects -Contains "MyProject"

Name  Enabled Default Description
----  ------- ------- -----------

This gets the processes with their associated projects and filters the list
to the one which contains a particular project, the "Scrum" template in this example.
